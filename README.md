# PEPEPOW

PEPEW (PEPEPOW) is a cryptocurrency with no owner or central authority. Based on memes and utilizing the Dash hybrid PoW / Masternode consensus algorithm for network security and decentralization. The coin is named after a popular internet meme that represents a frog, hence its mascot is also a frog who wants to dig for coins. Anyone can be a governor of PEPEW Proof of Work and share ownership of the coin, by deploying a master node or participating in mining with your home computer.

<B> on Feb 12th 2024 my Discord account (Foztor#2490) had its auth token stolen, and the account has since been banned. I'm back as Foztor_ and we believe no integrity was compromised - the crooks were just trying to fleece on you various scams.

With enough support - PEPEPOW is set to become the second most popular proof-of-work (PoW) driven meme coin, behind DogeCoin!<p>
